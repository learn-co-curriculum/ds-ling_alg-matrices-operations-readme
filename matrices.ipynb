    "A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers written between square brackets. As compared to vectors, a matrix is a multi-dimensional array of scalars that can possibly have multiple rows as well as columns. It usually denoted by an **m x n** notation where n is the number of rows and M is number of columns. A matrix is usually written down as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here m1,..,m9 are scalar values. \n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, a vector is known to be a special case of a matrix. A vector is a matrix that has only 1 column so you have an N x 1 matrix. N is the number of rows, and 1 here is the number of columns, so, so matrix with just one column is what we call a vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "We counter matrices in machine learning during model training where data is comprised of many rows and columns and often represented using the capital letter “X”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the dimensions of the matrix are denoted as m and n for the number of rows and the number of columns.\n",

    "A matrix and a vector can be multiplied together as long as the rule of matrix multiplication (stated above) is observed. The number of columns in the matrix must equal the number of rows in the vector. As with matrix multiplication, the operation can be written using the dot notation. Because the vector only has one column, the result is always a vector. See the general approach below where A is the matrix being multiplied to v, a vector\n",
